# Getting Started - Setting up your Development Environment

Welcome to the workshop 'Extend SAP S/4HANA with SAP Extension Suite'.\
This workshop will guide you step-by-step through the process of 
- creating new data models and a service using the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)
- integrating a service from the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/)
- creating a List Report Object Page application based on Fiori elements (FE) using the new service
- configuring and running a predefined Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and deploys your code changes to the SAP Business Technology Platform
