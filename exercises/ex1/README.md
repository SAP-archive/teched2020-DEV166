# Exercise 1 - Create a Cloud Application Programming Model Service and a Fiori Elements Application

In this exercise, we will create an application based on a data model and service created using the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and a UI based on Fiori elements (FE) which in turn is based on UI5.

## ###############################################################

## Exercise 1.1 Create a CAP-Based Service

In this part, you create a new CAP-based service, which exposes the OData V4 protocol. To do so, you use CAP's tooling `cds init` and `cds watch` in a terminal.

### Create and Initialize the Project

1. In the Business Application Studio click on **Start from template**
![new project](../ex1/images/01_01_0010.png)
2. Select **CAP Project** and press **Start**
![cap project](../ex1/images/01_01_0020.png)
3. Enter 'RiskManagement' as a project name. Don't tick any of the checkboxes below.
![new name](../ex1/images/01_01_0030.png)
4. After the project has been generated, click on **Finish** and **Open in New Workspace** on the pop up in the lower right corner
![new wrokspace](../ex1/images/01_01_0040.png)
5. The new workspace will open and it will show the generated 'RiskManagement' project like this:
![project view](../ex1/images/01_01_0050.png)

6. In Business Application Studio choose **Terminal -> New Terminal** from its menu.

    A new terminal opens in the lower right part of the Business Application Studio screen.

7. In the terminal, install the dependencies for the project
    ```
	npm i 
    ```
8. In the terminal, start a CAP server by typing:
    ```
    cds watch
    ```
    The CAP server serves all the CAP sources from your project. It also "watches" all the files in your projects and conveniently restarts the server whenever you save a file. Changes you've made will immediately be served without you having to do anything.

    The screen now looks like this:
    ![project view](../ex1/images/01_01_0060.png)
    `cds watch` tells you that there’s no model yet that it can serve. You add one in the next steps.

	In general you can keep `cds watch` running in a terminal for the whole exercise. There is no need to restart it or try to add a second instance of it (in fact, if you do this, you get an error, described [here](#cdswatcherror)). In the follow up chapters you will open a new browser tab to see the results of `cds watch`. You can just keep this open and refresh it each time there is a change. `cds watch` notices any file change and makes sure you get the new results after a refresh in the browser.
 
### Add a Data Model to the Project

In this part we create a data model using the Core Data Services (CDS) format from CAP.

1. In the project, go to folder **db**, representing the data model on the data base. In the context menu, select **New File**
2. Enter **schema.cds** as a name
3. Click on the new file in the explorer, an editor opens
4. Enter the following lines into the editor

```javascript
namespace sap.ui.riskmanagement;
using { managed } from '@sap/cds/common';

  entity Risks : managed {
    key ID      : UUID  @(Core.Computed : true);
    title       : String(100);
    owner       : String;
    prio        : String(5);
    descr       : String;
    miti        : Association to Mitigations;
    impact      : Integer;
    //bp          : Association to BusinessPartners;
    criticality : Integer;
  }

  entity Mitigations : managed {
    key ID       : UUID  @(Core.Computed : true);
    description  : String;
    owner        : String;
    timeline     : String;
    risks        : Association to many Risks on risks.miti = $self;
  }
```

5. Save the file

This creates 2 entities in the namespace **sap.ui.riskmanagement**, **Risks**, and **Mitigations**. Each of them has a key called **ID** and several other properties. A **Risk** has a mitigation and therefore, the property **miti** has an association to exactly one **Mitigation**. A Mitigation in turn can be used for many Risks, so it has a "too many" association. The key is automatically filled by CAP, which is exposed to the user of the service with the annotation `@(Core.Computed : true)`.

At this point, you can neglect the commented property **bp** (as well as the other commented lines further down in the file and in subsequent files and chapters). All the commented lines are later used and uncommented when you introduce a reference to a Business Partner entity. For now you don't need it, though.

The screen now looks like this:

![project view](../ex1/images/01_01_0070.png)


Notice how `cds watch` reacted to dropping the file. It now tells you that it has a model but there are no service definitions yet and thus it still can’t serve anything. So, you will add a service definition.

### Add a Service to the Project

In this part we create a new service with 2 entities, both are projections of the data models that we created in the chapter before.

1. In the project, go to folder **srv**, representing the service. In the context menu, select **New File**
2. Enter **risk-service.cds** as a name
3. Click on the new file in the explorer, an editor opens
4. Enter the following lines into the editor

```javascript
using { sap.ui.riskmanagement as my } from '../db/schema';

@path: 'service/risk'
service RiskService {
  entity Risks as projection on my.Risks;
    annotate Risks with @odata.draft.enabled; 
  entity Mitigations as projection on my.Mitigations;
    annotate Mitigations with @odata.draft.enabled;
  //entity BusinessPartners as projection on my.BusinessPartners; 
}
```

  This creates a new service **RiskService** in the namespace **sap.ui.riskmanagement**. This service exposes 2 entities (again just neglect the commented part for the business partner), **Risks** and **Mitigations**, which are both just exposing the entities of the data base schema you’ve created in the step before.

  If you again look at the terminal, you see that `cds watch` has noticed the new file and now tells us that it serves something:

![service](../ex1/images/01_01_0080.png)

5. Press the **Expose and Open** button
6. If you are asked to enter a name - just press return

You now see this screen:

![service2](../ex1/images/01_01_0090.png)

7. Click the **$metadata** link 

The service already exposes a full blown OData metadata document

8. Now go back and click on the **Risks** link.

This exposes the data for the Risks entity. As there is no data yet, you only see this:

```javascript
{
    @odata.context: "$metadata#Risks",
    value: [ ]
}
```

Don't close the window, you will need it again.

### Add Data for the Service
 
In this part we add data to the service. It is local data that is stored in a local data base called SQLite that CAP invokes behind the scences. CAP makes it easy to add such test data to a service, all it needs is a Comma Separated Values file which contains the entities' elements as column headers.

1. In the project, go to folder **db**.  In the context menu, select **New Folder**
2. Enter **data** as a name
3. On the **data** folder, in the context menu, select **New File**
2. Enter **sap.ui.riskmanagement-Risks.csv** as a name
5. Click on the new file in the explorer, an editor opens
6. Enter the following lines into the editor

```csv
ID;createdAt;createdBy;title;owner;prio;descr;miti_id;impact

```
7. Save the file
8. On the **data** folder, in the context menu, select **New File**
9. Enter **sap.ui.riskmanagement-Mitigations.csv** as a name
10. Click on the new file in the explorer, an editor opens
11. Enter the following lines into the editor

```csv
ID;createdAt;createdBy;description;owner;timeline

```
12. Save the file

The files have the name of the namespace of the entities in the data model (e.g. **sap.ui.riskmanagement**), followed by a '-' and the name of the entity (e.g. **Risks**). When adhering to this naming convention CAP recognizes the file as data for the data model and automatically adds it to the built in SQLite data base.
Looking at the contents of the file **sap.ui.riskmanagement-Risks.csv**, the first line contains all the properties from your **Risks** entity. While the other ones are straightforward, consider the **miti_id** property. In your entity, you only have a **miti** property, so where does this come from? **miti** is an association to **Mitigations**, as **Mitigations** could have several key properties, the association on the data base needs to point to all of these, therefore CAP creates a property **<AssocuiationProperty>_<AssociatedEntityKey>** for each key.

As always `cds watch` has noticed the change.

12. Return to the browser window where the service is still shown and press **refresh** in the browser. It will now show values for **Risks**

![risksdata](../ex1/images/01_01_0100.png)


You’ve now got a full blown OData service, which complies to the OData standard and supports the respective queries without having to code anything but the data model and exposing the service itself.

*Note:* The service is completely exposed without any authentication or authorization check. You will extend the service later with such checks.

## Exercise 1.2 Create an SAP Fiori Elements-Based Application

An Fiori elements (FE) app is an application that leverages SAPUI5, its controls and its model view controller (MVC) concepts. As opposed to a plain UI5 or freestyle UI5 app, where one has all the views and controllers as part of one's projects, most of the code of an FE app is outside of the project, managed centrally be the FE team. The code inside one's project only references these central components, which take care of creating the UI according to the latest SAP Fiori design guidelines and covers all the controller logic for you out of the box. The UI can be influenced by OData annotations. They determine, for example, which properties of an OData service make up the columns of a table which displays the content of the service.

### Generate the UI with an SAP Fiori Elements Template

1. In Business Application Studio, invoke the Command Palette (```View -> Find Command``` or ```Cmd+Shift+P```) and choose ```Fiori: Open Application Generator```.

  	![appgen](../ex1/images/01_02_0010.png)

2. Choose `SAP Fiori Elements` and `List Report Object Page` and press **Next**

   	![Feapp](../ex1/images/01_02_0030.png)


3. In the next dialog, choose **Use a Local CAP Node.js Project** and point to the folder of your current ```RiskManagement``` project. Select the ``RiskService`` as the OData service and click **Next**

   	![Feapp](../ex1/images/01_02_0040.png)

4.	Choose ```Risks``` as the main entity and click **Next**

   	![Feapp](../ex1/images/01_02_0050.png)

5. Enter "risks" as the module name. Enter "Risks" as the application title and the description for the application, as well as "ns" as the namespace. Choose "No" in the checkboxes and press **Finish**

    ![Feapp](../ex1/images/01_02_0060.png)

(If you get a pop up that says "A project has been generated. What would you like to do with it?", you can ignore it and just close the pop up)

The application is now generated and after a couple of seconds you can see it in the ```app``` folder of your project. It contains a ```risks``` and a ```webapp``` folder with a ```Component.js``` file, which is characteristic for a UI5 app. However, the code there’s minimal and it basically inherits its logic from the ```sap/fe/core/AppComponent```.

6. If ```cds watch``` isn't still running from the previous chapter, execute it in a terminal and press on the **Open in New Tab** button in the right lower corner. If it is still running from the last chapter, it is enough to refresh the brower page were it is running.

    You can now see that ```cds watch``` has discovered an HTML page in your app folder:

    ![Feapp](../ex1/images/01_02_0070.png)

7. Click on this link. On the launch page that now comes up, click on the **Risks** tile.

	You can now see the list page, it looks like this:

    ![EmptyLR](../ex1/images/01_02_0075.png)

    Unfortunately, the app looks rather empty, for example, the list has no columns yet. This is because we miss an essential part of a Fiori elements application that tells it about columns, form fields and a lot of other things: It is missing UI annotations. 

### Modify the UI with OData Annotations

1. To add the OData annotations, in the project, go to folder **srv** representing the service and select **New File** in the context menu

2. Enter **risks-service-ui.cds** as a name

3. Click on the new file in the explorer, an editor opens

4. Enter the following lines into the editor

```javascript
using RiskService from './risk-service';

annotate RiskService.Risks with {
  title       @title: 'Title';
  owner       @title: 'Owner';
  prio        @title: 'Priority';
  descr       @title: 'Description';   
  miti        @title: 'Mitigation'; 
  //bp          @title: 'Business Partner';   
  impact      @title: 'Impact'; 
}

annotate RiskService.Mitigations with {
	ID @(
		UI.Hidden,
		Common: {
		Text: description
		}
	);    
	description  @title: 'Description';   
	owner        @title: 'Owner'; 
	timeline     @title: 'Timeline';   
	risks        @title: 'Risks'; 
}

annotate RiskService.Risks with @(
	UI: {
		HeaderInfo: {
			TypeName: 'Risk',
			TypeNamePlural: 'Risks'
		},
		SelectionFields: [prio],
		LineItem: [
			{Value: title},
			{Value: miti_ID},
            {Value: owner},
			//{Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
			{
				Value: prio,
				Criticality: criticality 
			}
			,
			{
				Value: impact,
				Criticality: criticality
			}
		],
		Facets: [
			{$Type: 'UI.ReferenceFacet', Label: 'Main', Target: '@UI.FieldGroup#Main'}
		],
		FieldGroup#Main: {
			Data: [
				{Value: title},
				{Value: miti_ID},
				{Value: descr},
                {Value: owner},
				{
					Value: prio,
					Criticality: criticality
				},
				//{Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
				{
					Value: impact,
					Criticality: criticality
				}			
			]
		}		
	},
) {

}; 

annotate RiskService.Risks with {
	miti @(	
		Common: {
			//show text, not id for mitigation in the context of risks
			Text: miti.description  , TextArrangement: #TextOnly,
			ValueList: {
				Label: 'Mitigations',
				CollectionPath: 'Mitigations',
				Parameters: [
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', 
						LocalDataProperty: miti_ID, 
						ValueListProperty: 'ID' 
					},
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', 
						ValueListProperty: 'description' 
					}                                      
				]
			}
		},
		UI.MultiLineText: IsActiveEntity
	);
  /*
	bp @(	
		Common: {
			Text: bp.LastName  , TextArrangement: #TextOnly,
			ValueList: {
				Label: 'Business Partners',
				CollectionPath: 'BusinessPartners',
				Parameters: [
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', 
						LocalDataProperty: bp_BusinessPartner, 
						ValueListProperty: 'BusinessPartner' 
					},
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', 
						ValueListProperty: 'LastName' 
					},
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', 
						ValueListProperty: 'FirstName' 
					}      					                                   
				]
			}
		}
	)	
  */
}

/*
annotate RiskService.BusinessPartners with {
	BusinessPartner @(
		UI.Hidden,
		Common: {
		Text: LastName
		}
	);   
	LastName    @title: 'Last Name';  
	FirstName   @title: 'First Name';   
}
*/
```

5. Save the file

	As in the steps before, ```cds watch``` has noticed the new file and compiled the service again, so now it contains the additional annotations.

6. In the browser, reload the test page which shows the service and the index page. Click on the index page link `/risks/webapp/index.html`. On the launch page that now comes up, click on the **Risks** tile. Click **Go**. It now shows a work list with some columns and the data from the service.

    ![Feapp2](../ex1/images/01_02_0080.png)

    You’ve now already finished a full blown service and a full blown UI application on top running locally.

### Check the Annotation Files

Let's have a look at the new cds file and the annotations in there. At the beginning we see:

```javascript
using RiskService from './risk-service';

annotate RiskService.Risks with {
	title       @title: 'Title';
	prio        @title: 'Priority';
	descr       @title: 'Description';
	miti        @title: 'Mitigation';
	//bp          @title: 'Business Partner';
	impact      @title: 'Impact';
}
```

It's referring to the definitions of the earlier cds file that exposes the service and its ```risks``` and mitigations ```entites```. Then it annotates the ```risk``` entity with a number of texts. These should be in a translatable file normally but for now we keep them here. These texts are used as labels in form fields and column headers by FE.

Next up:

```javascript
annotate RiskService.Risks with @(
	UI: {
		HeaderInfo: {
			TypeName: 'Risk',
			TypeNamePlural: 'Risks'
		},
		SelectionFields: [prio],
		LineItem: [
			{Value: title},
			{Value: miti_ID},
			{Value: owner},
			// {Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
			{
				Value: prio,
				Criticality: criticality
			},
			{
				Value: impact,
				Criticality: criticality
			}
		],
		Facets: [
			{$Type: 'UI.ReferenceFacet', Label: 'Main', Target: '@UI.FieldGroup#Main'}
		],
		FieldGroup#Main: {
			Data: [
				{Value: title},
				{Value: miti_ID},
				{Value: descr},
				{Value: owner},
				{
					Value: prio,
					Criticality: criticality
				},
				// {Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
				{
					Value: impact,
					Criticality: criticality
				}
			]
		}
	},
) {

};
```

This defines the content of the work list page and the object page, which one navigates to when clicking on a line in the work list.

The ```SelectionFields``` section defines which of the properties are exposed as search fields in the header bar above the list, in this case ```prio``` is the only explicit search field.

From the ```LineItem``` section all the columns and their order of the work list are derived. While in most cases the columns are defined by ```Value:``` followed by the property name of the entity, in the case of ```prio```and ```impact``` there’s also ```Criticality```, which for now you can neglect, but keep it in mind in case you go to the later modules. It currently adds a diamond icon ( &#x20df; ) right left of the fields. You can just ignore it.

Next up the ```Facets``` section. In this case, it defines the content of the object page. It contains only a single facet, a ```ReferenceFacet```, of the field group ```FieldGroup#Main```. This field group just shows up as a form. The properties of the ```Data``` array within ```FieldGroup#Main``` determine the fields in the form:

![FeappObjectPage](../ex1/images/01_02_0090.png)

The last part is the most complicated one:
```js
annotate RiskService.Risks with {
	miti @(	
		Common: {
			//show text, not id for mitigation in the context of risks
			Text: miti.description  , TextArrangement: #TextOnly,
			ValueList: {
				Label: 'Mitigations',
				CollectionPath: 'Mitigations',
				Parameters: [
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', 
						LocalDataProperty: miti_ID, 
						ValueListProperty: 'ID' 
					},
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', 
						ValueListProperty: 'description' 
					}                                      
				]
			}
		},
		UI.MultiLineText: IsActiveEntity
	);
}
```

Without these lines, we would see the id of the mitigations from the ```miti``` field, in both the list and the object page:

![mitinoanno](../ex1/images/01_02_0100.png)

![mitinoanno2](../ex1/images/01_02_0110.png)

By introducing the annotations for the ```miti``` property, instead of just displaying the original value of ```miti```, i.e. the id, the UI shows its ```description``` property.
The subsequent part ```ValueList``` introduces a value help for ```miti``` that you can see on the object page in its edit mode. The value help takes the id as an input parameter and again displays the ```description``` parameter.

![mitianno](../ex1/images/01_02_0120.png)

![mitianno2](../ex1/images/01_02_0130.png)


## ###############################################################

## Exercise 1.3 Add Business Logic to Your Application

In this chapter, you add custom code to the CAP service, that changes depending on the value of the property ```impact``` and the value of the property ```criticality```, which in turn is used in OData annotations to control the color of some of the cells in the table of our work list page.

### Add Custom Code

1. In the project, go to folder **srv**, representing the service, and select **New File** in the context menu
2. Enter **risk-service.js** as a name
3. Click on the new file in the explorer, an editor opens
4. Enter the following lines into the editor

```javascript
/**
 * Implementation for Risk Management service defined in ./risk-service.cds
 */
module.exports = async (srv) => {
    srv.after('READ', 'Risks', (risks) => {

        risks.forEach((risk) => {
            if (risk.impact >= 100000) {
                risk.criticality = 1;
            } else {
                risk.criticality = 2;
            }
        });
    });
}
```

5. Save the file
6. In the browser, reload the page of the Fiori Elements app

	It now shows our work list with the columns ```Priority``` and ```Impact``` with color and an icon, depending on the amount in ```impact```.

	![FeappObjectPage](../ex1/images/01_03_0010.png)

### Explanation of the Custom Code

Because your file is called ```risks-service.js``` and therefore has the same name as your service definition file ```risks-service.cds```, CAP automatically treats it as a handler file for the service defined in there. CAP exposes several [events](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/cap/node.js/api#cds-event-handlers) and you can easily write handlers as the one above.

In this case, the event ```after``` is triggered after a `READ` was carried out for our ```Risks``` entity. In your custom handler you get all the data, in this case all the risks that were read according to the query. You can loop over each of them and, if needed, adjust the data of the response. In this case, you change the value of the ```criticality``` when the ```impact``` is bigger than 100000. The new values for ```criticality``` are then part of the response to the read request.

So, this affects the service's response, but how does this translate into a changed UI? In order to do this, you have to go back to the annotations you created in chapter 3, where you find your ```srv/risks-service-ui.cds``` file. There you had the two columns ```prio``` and ```impact``` annotated with an additional ```Criticality``` annotation. This annotation points to the ```criticality``` property of your service (*Note:* `Criticality` with an upper case `C` is the annotation, while the property name `criticality` could also be called different opposed to the annotation). As you now set different values in your custom handler for ```criticality```, the Fiori Elements application translates these into icons and colors, which you can see in the UI.

```javascript
annotate RiskService.Risks with @(
	UI: {
		...
		...
		LineItem: [
			...
			...
			{
				Value: prio,
				Criticality: criticality
			},
			{
				Value: impact,
				Criticality: criticality
			}
		],

## Exercise 1.4 Add the Consumption of an External Service Exposed by SAP API Business Hub to Your Service


In this chapter, you extend your CAP service with the consumption of an external Business Partner service. You get its definition from SAP's API Business Hub. Firstly, work with local data and later on get the data directly from the external SAP S/4HANA system. What you have to do is:

### Get the Business Partner EDMX File

1. Open the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/) page in your browser
2. Type "business partner" into the page's search field and carry out the search
3. On the left side, expand ```Products``` and mark ```SAP S/4 HANA Cloud```
4. In the result list, choose ```Business Partner (A2X)```
5. Choose the ```Details``` tab

    ![API Details](../ex1/images/01_03_0030.png)

6. Click the ```Download API Specification``` button
7. Choose the ```EDMX``` option from the list (if you’re asked to log on, log on, it works automatically)

    If you’re using Chrome as a browser, you now see the downloaded file in the footer bar:
    ![API EDMX](../ex1/images/01_03_0040.png)


### Add the EDMX File to the Project and Add Local Data

1. Make sure in your terminal ```cds watch``` is still running
2. Drag the ```API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.edmx``` file from your browser's download area/folder onto your Business Application Studio workplace and drop it into the ```srv``` folder of your ```cpapp``` app

    CAP has noticed the new file and automatically created a new ```external``` folder under ```srv``` and in it added a new ```API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn``` file. ([CSN](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/cap/cds/csn) being a compact representation of CDS)


3. In your project, open the ```db/schema.cds``` file again and change the parts of the file as indicated below. 

From now on the exercises will mark code blocks that need to be inserted inbetween the following lines (which are not to be copied):

***//### BEGIN OF INSERT***

before the lines of code that have to be inserted and 

***//### END OF OF INSERT***

after the lines to be inserted. The same is true for lines to be deleted:

***//### BEGIN OF OF DELETE***

***//### END OF OF DELETE***


```javascript
namespace sap.ui.riskmanagement;
using { managed } from '@sap/cds/common';
  entity Risks : managed {
    key ID      : UUID  @(Core.Computed : true);
    title       : String(100);
    prio        : String(5);
    descr       : String;
    miti        : Association to Mitigations;
    impact      : Integer;
    //bp        : Association to BusinessPartners;  
    criticality : Integer;
  }
  entity Mitigations : managed {
    key ID       : UUID  @(Core.Computed : true);
    description  : String;
    owner        : String;
    timeline     : String;
    risks        : Association to many Risks on risks.miti = $self;
  }

//### BEGIN OF INSERT

// using an external service from S/4
 using {  API_BUSINESS_PARTNER as external } from '../srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn';

 entity BusinessPartners as projection on external.A_BusinessPartner {
    key BusinessPartner,
    LastName,
    FirstName
  }

//### END OF OF INSERT

```

  With this code you create a so-called projection for your new service. Of the many entities and properties in these entities, that are defined in the ```API_BUSINESS_PARTNER``` service, you just look at one of the entities (```A_BusinessPartner```) and just three of its properties: ```BusinessPartner```, ```LastName```, and ```FirstName```, so your projection is using a subset of everything the original service has to offer.

4. Open the ```srv/risk-service.cds``` file

5. Uncomment the ```entity BusinessPartner``` line

```javascript
using { sap.ui.riskmanagement as my } from '../db/schema';
@path: 'service/risk'
service RiskService {
  entity Risks as projection on my.Risks;
    annotate Risks with @odata.draft.enabled;
  entity Mitigations as projection on my.Mitigations;
    annotate Mitigations with @odata.draft.enabled;
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
  //entity BusinessPartners as projection on my.BusinessPartners;
//### END OF DELETE
//### BEGIN OF INSERT
  entity BusinessPartners as projection on my.BusinessPartners;
  //### END OF INSERT
}
```

6. In your browser, where the Fiori elements app is still running from the last chapter, press on the SAP icon on the left upper corner. This way you navigate back to the index page. Press refresh in your browser. Now press on the **Risks** tile and in the application press **Go**

    The browser now shows a ```BusinessPartner```service next to the ```Mitigations``` and ```Risks```

    ![BPService](../ex1/images/01_03_0050.png)

    At this point, you have a new service exposed with a definition based on the original ```edmx``` file. However, it doesn't have any connectivity to a backend and thus, there’s no data yet. Such as with your own entities ```risks``` and ```mitigations```, you create new local data.

7. In the project, go to the folder **srv/external** and select **New Folder** from the context menu
8. Enter **data** as a name
9. In the **data** folder, select **New File** from the context menu
10. Enter **API_BUSINESS_PARTNER-A_BusinessPartner.csv** as a name
11. Click on the new file in the explorer, an editor opens
12. Enter the following lines into the editor

```csv
BusinessPartner;LastName;FirstName
1004155;Watson;Alice
1004161;Lynotte;Phil
1004100;Masci;J
``` 

13. Save the file

14. Open the ```srv/risk-service.js``` file

15. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```javascript
/**
 * Implementation for Risk Management service defined in ./risk-service.cds
 */
module.exports = async (srv) => {
    srv.after('READ', 'Risks', (risks) => {
        risks.forEach((risk) => {
            if (risk.impact >= 100000) {
                risk.criticality = 1;
            } else {
                risk.criticality = 2;
            }
        });
    });
//### BEGIN OF INSERT

    const BupaService = await cds.connect.to('API_BUSINESS_PARTNER');
    srv.on('READ', srv.entities.BusinessPartners, async (req) => {
        return await BupaService.tx(req).run(req.query);
    });
//### END OF INSERT
}
```

You've now created a custom handler for your service. This time it called ```on``` for the ```READ``` event. 

It is invoked when your ```BusinessPartner``` service is called for a read, so whenever there’s a request for business partner data, this handler is called. It makes sure the request for the business partner is directed to the external business partner service.

16. Save the file

17. In your browser, open the ```BusinessPartners``` link to see the data

    ![API EDMX](../ex1/images/01_03_0020.png)

    In the next step, you change the code, so that the data is fetched from the actual service in an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.




## ###############################################################

## Exercise 1.5 Consume the External Service in Your UI Application

In this chapter, you incorporate the external service into the UI application.

1. Open the ```db/data/schema.cds``` file
2. Uncomment the ```bp``` property

```javascript
namespace sap.ui.riskmanagement;
using { managed } from '@sap/cds/common';
  entity Risks : managed {
    key ID      : UUID  @(Core.Computed : true);
    title       : String(100);
    prio        : String(5);
    descr       : String;
    miti        : Association to Mitigations;
    impact      : Integer;
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
   //bp          : Association to BusinessPartners;   
//### END OF DELETE
//### BEGIN OF INSERT
   bp          : Association to BusinessPartners;  
//### END OF INSERT
    criticality : Integer;
  }
  entity Mitigations : managed {
    key ID       : UUID  @(Core.Computed : true);
    description  : String;
    owner        : String;
    timeline     : String;
    risks        : Association to many Risks on risks.miti = $self;
  }
  // using an external service from S/4
  using {  API_BUSINESS_PARTNER as external } from '../srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn';
  entity BusinessPartners as projection on external.A_BusinessPartner {
    key BusinessPartner,
    LastName,
    FirstName
  }
```

As you got a new property in your entity, you need to add data for this property in the local data file that you've created before for the ```risk``` entity.


3. Open the file `sap.ui.riskmanagement-Risks.csv` in your `db/data` folder
4. Replace the content with the new content below which additionally includes the BP data

```csv
ID;createdAt;createdBy;title;owner;prio;descr;miti_id;impact;bp_BusinessPartner
20466922-7d57-4e76-b14c-e53fd97dcb11;2019-10-24;tim.back@sap.com;CFR non-compliance;Fred Fish;3;Recent restructuring might violate CFR code 71;20466921-7d57-4e76-b14c-e53fd97dcb11;10000;1004155

20466922-7d57-4e76-b14c-e53fd97dcb13;2019-10-24;tim.back@sap.com;Shipment violating export control;Herbert Hunter;1;Violation of export and trade control with unauthorized downloads;20466921-7d57-4e76-b14c-e53fd97dcb13;200000;1004100
```

5. Save the file

  If you check the content of the file, you see numbers like ```1004155``` at the end of the lines, representing business partners.


### Add the Business Partner Field to the UI

Now, you also introduce the business partner field in the UI. For this you need to perform the following steps:

- Add a label for the columns in the result list table as well as in the object page by adding a title annotation
- Add the business partner as a line item to include it as a column in the result list
- Add the business partner as a field to a field group, which makes it appear in a form on the object page

All this happens in the cds file that has all the UI annotations.

1. Open the ```srv/risks-service-ui.cds``` file
2. Uncomment the following parts:

```javascript 
	using RiskService from './risk-service';

	annotate RiskService.Risks with {
		...
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
     //bp          @title: 'Business Partner';
//### END OF DELETE
//### BEGIN OF INSERT
     bp          @title: 'Business Partner';
//### END OF INSERT
      ...
	}


	annotate RiskService.Risks with @(
		UI: {
			...
			LineItem: [
				...
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
       //{Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
//### END OF DELETE
//### BEGIN OF INSERT
				{Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
//### END OF INSERT
				...
			],
			...
			FieldGroup#Main: {
				Data: [
					...

//### BEGIN OF DELETE
         //{Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
//### END OF DELETE
//### BEGIN OF INSERT
					{Value: bp_BusinessPartner},
//### END OF INSERT
					...
				]
			}
		},
	) {

	};


annotate RiskService.Risks with {
	miti @(	
		Common: {
			//show text, not id for mitigation in the context of risks
			Text: miti.description  , TextArrangement: #TextOnly,
			ValueList: {
				Label: 'Mitigations',
				CollectionPath: 'Mitigations',
				Parameters: [
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', 
						LocalDataProperty: miti_ID, 
						ValueListProperty: 'ID' 
					},
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', 
						ValueListProperty: 'description' 
					}                                      
				]
			}
		},
		UI.MultiLineText: IsActiveEntity
	);
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
  /*
//### END OF DELETE
	bp @(	
		Common: {
			Text: bp.LastName  , TextArrangement: #TextOnly,
			ValueList: {
				Label: 'Business Partners',
				CollectionPath: 'BusinessPartners',
				Parameters: [
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', 
						LocalDataProperty: bp_BusinessPartner, 
						ValueListProperty: 'BusinessPartner' 
					},
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', 
						ValueListProperty: 'LastName' 
					},
					{ $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', 
						ValueListProperty: 'FirstName' 
					}      					                                   
				]
			}
		}
	)	
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
  */

/*
//### END OF DELETE
annotate RiskService.BusinessPartners with {
	BusinessPartner @(
		UI.Hidden,
		Common: {
		Text: LastName
		}
	);   
	LastName    @title: 'Last Name';  
	FirstName   @title: 'First Name';   
}
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
*/
//### END OF DELETE
}
```

What does this mean? The first parts that are getting rid of the comments are easy: They just enable the title and add the business partner first as a column to the list and then as a field to the object page, just like other columns and fields were added before. 

The larger part of new annotations activates the same qualitites for the ```bp``` field as it happened before in exercise 1.2 for the ```miti``` field: Instead of showing the id of the business partner, its ```LastName```property is displayed. The ```ValueList``` part introduces a value list for the business partner and shows it last and first name in it.


3. Save the file
4. Open the ```srv/risk-service.js``` file
5. Add the following lines to the file:

```js
module.exports = async (srv) => {
    srv.after('READ', 'Risks', (risks) => {

        risks.forEach((risk) => {
            if (risk.impact >= 100000) {
                risk.criticality = 1;
            } else {
                risk.criticality = 2;
            }
        });
    });

    const BupaService = await cds.connect.to('API_BUSINESS_PARTNER');
    srv.on('READ', srv.entities.BusinessPartners, async (req) => {
        return await BupaService.tx(req).run(req.query);
    });
//### BEGIN OF INSERT

    srv.on('READ', 'Risks', async (req, next) => {
        /*
        Check whether the request want an "expand" of the business partner
        As this is not possible, the risk entity and the business partner entity are in different systems (Cloud Platform and S/4 HANA Cloud),
        if there is such an expand, remove it
        */
        const expandIndex = req.query.SELECT.columns.findIndex(({ expand, ref }) => expand && ref[0] === 'bp');
        console.log(req.query.SELECT.columns)
        if (expandIndex < 0) return next();

        req.query.SELECT.columns.splice(expandIndex, 1);
        if (!req.query.SELECT.columns.find( column => column.ref.find( ref => ref == "bp_BusinessPartner" ))) {
            req.query.SELECT.columns.push({ ref: ["bp_BusinessPartner"] });
        }
        
        /*
        Instead of carrying out the expand, issue a separate request for each business partner
        This code could be optimized, instead of having n requests for n business partners, just on bulk request could be created
        */
        const res = await next();
        await Promise.all( 
            res.map( async risk => {
                const bp = await BupaService
                    .tx(req)
                    .run(SELECT.one(srv.entities.BusinessPartners).where({ BusinessPartner: risk.bp_BusinessPartner })
                    .columns([ "BusinessPartner", "LastName", "FirstName" ]));
                risk.bp = bp;
                console.dir(risk.bp)
            }
        ));
        return res;
    });
//### END OF INSERT
}
```

Again you have now added a custom handler, this one is called ```on``` a ```READ``` of the ```Risks``` service. It checks whether the request includes a so-called expand for business partners. This is a request that is issued by the UI when the list should be filled. While it mostly contains columns that directly belong to the ```Risks``` entity, it also contains the business partner. As we have seen in the annotation file, instead of showing the id of the business partner, the last name of the business partner will be shown. This data is in the business partner and not in the risks entity. Therefore, the UI wants to expand, i.e. for each risk the corresponing business partner is also read.

However, there is an issue with this: The ```Risk``` entity is from the Cloud Platform, the busines partner, however, is potentially from a remote S/4 HANA Cloud system. In such a case the expand cannot be carried out. Because of this, we need to remove the expand from the request. Instead the code issues separate requests for each business partner directly to the business partner service. As the code stands, for each risk there is a separate request for a business partner. This is not optimal, it would be better if all the business partners were fetched in a bulk request. You can make this change on your own if you like!

6. Save the file
7. In your tab with the application, go back to the **index.html** page and press refresh 

8. On the launch page that now comes up, choose the **Risks** tile and then click **Go**

	You now see the ```Risks``` application with the business partner data in both the result list and the object page, which is loaded when you click on one of the rows in the table:

	![Business Partner Data](../ex1/images/01_04_0010.png "Business Partner Data")

	![Business Partner Data](../ex1/images/01_04_0020.png "Business Partner Data")



## ###############################################################

## Exercise 1.6  Roles and Authorization Checks In CAP

In this exercise we will add authorizations to the CAP service, so that only users with the right authorization can view the data or even edit and create data. We will also add a mock user locally to test the functionality.

### Enable Authentication Support

The enable authentication support in CAP, a `node.js` module called `passport`  needs to be installed.

1. Navigate to your ```RiskManagement``` folder in a terminal in the Business Application Studio. With your `cds watch` still running in one terminal, it is the easiest to open another second terminal next to it, by invoking **Terminal** and the **New Terminal** in the menu. Alternatively, you can also suspend `cds watch` in your existing terminal by pressing **CTRL+C**. In both cases you should already be in the ```Riskmanagement``` folder

2. Install the ```passport``` module. (the --save part makes sure it’s also added as a dependency to your project's ```package.json```)

    ```bash
    npm install --save passport
    ```

### Adding Cap Role Restrictions to Entities

In this step we add the authorizations to the ```Risks``` service.

1. Open the file ```srv/risk-service.cds```

2. Change the code in the following way and, by this, add the  restrictions (`@(...)`) block to your `Risks` and `Mitigations` entities

```js
using { sap.ui.riskmanagement as my } from '../db/schema';
@path: 'service/risk'
service RiskService {
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
  entity Risks as projection on my.Risks;
//### END OF DELETE
//### BEGIN OF INSERT
  entity Risks @(restrict : [
            {
                grant : [ 'READ' ],
                to : [ 'RiskViewer' ]
            },
            {
                grant : [ '*' ],
                to : [ 'RiskManager' ]
            }
        ]) as projection on my.Risks;
//### END OF INSERT
    annotate Risks with @odata.draft.enabled;
//### BEGIN OF DELETE
  entity Mitigations as projection on my.Mitigations;
//### END OF DELETE
//### BEGIN OF INSERT
  entity Mitigations @(restrict : [
            {
                grant : [ 'READ' ],
                to : [ 'RiskViewer' ]
            },
            {
                grant : [ '*' ],
                to : [ 'RiskManager' ]
            }
        ]) as projection on my.Mitigations;
//### END OF INSERT
    annotate Mitigations with @odata.draft.enabled;
  entity BusinessPartners as projection on my.BusinessPartners;
}
```
3. Save the file

With this change users that have the role `RiskViewer` assigned can view ("read") risks and mitigations, and a user with role `RiskManager` can view and change risks and mitigations. They are granted all the authorizations ("*").

### Add Users for Local Testing

Since the authorization checks have been added to the CAP model, they apply not only when deployed to the cloud but also for local testing. Therefore, we need a way to log in to the application locally.

CAP offers a possibility to add local users for testing as part of the `cds` configuration. In this tutorial, we use the `.cdsrc.json` file to add the users.


1. In the project, go to the files **.cdsrc.json** and open it for editing
2. In the editor, replace its content with the following lines

```json
{
    "[development]": {
    "auth": {
      "passport": {
        "strategy": "mock",
        "users": {
          "risk.viewer@tester.sap.com": {
            "password": "initial",
            "ID": "riskviewer",
            "userAttributes": {
              "email": "risk.viewer@tester.sap.com"
            },
            "roles": [
              "RiskViewer"
            ]
          },
          "risk.manager@tester.sap.com": {
            "password": "initial",
            "ID": "riskmanager",
            "userAttributes": {
              "email": "risk.manager@tester.sap.com"
            },
            "roles": [
              "RiskManager"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save the file

    The file defines two users `riskviewer` and `riskmanager`. Let's look at the `riskmanager` example.


    The user is defined by an `ID`, which can be any identifier for a user. The user has an `email`, a `password` parameter, and a `roles` parameter. 

### Access the Risk Application with a User and Password

When accessing the `Risks` or the `Mitigations` service in the browser, you get a basic authorisation pop-up, asking for your user and password. You can use two users to log in and see that it works.

1. In the tab with the running application, navigate back to the launchpage, press refresh in the browser

2. Choose the **Risks** tile and in the app press **Go**

3. In the pop-up, enter the *Username*: `riskmanager`

4. Enter the *Password*: `initial`

![Authorizations](../ex1/images/01_06_0010.png)

5. You can now access the **Risks** application

Unfortunately, there’s no logout functionality. However, you can use the "Clear Browser Cache" function or simply close all browser windows to get rid of the basic authentication login data in the browser.


This is it! You have mastered all the steps to locally run the entire application!

Continue to - [Exercise 2](../ex2/README.md) in order to prepare everything that is needed to deploy the application to the Cloud Platform.



## Troubleshooting

### I get an "[ERROR] listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4004" when invoking cds watch <a name="cdswatcherror"></a>

You have probably still got `cds watch` running in one terminal and have started a new `cds watch` in another one. CAP allows only one instance to run, this is why you get the error. You can resolve the issue by pressing ***CTRL + C*** in one of the terminal. This will stop the current instance while the other one still continues running.
Normally closing the terminal in which the current instance runs will also terminate the `cds watch` process there. In some rare cases, the process still runs but is not visible anymore. In order to stopp such a process, once again open a terminal and type:

```
ps a
```

In the output you will find a line like this, indicating the `cds watch` instance:

```
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
   7897 pts/1    S+     0:00 node-10/node /home/user/.node_modules_global/bin/cds watch 
```

Copy the number under ***PID** (in the above case 7897) and carry out 

```
kill <PID Number>
```

in the terminal (in this example `kill 7897`). Now you can start `cds watch` again.
