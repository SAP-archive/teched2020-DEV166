# DEV166 - Extend SAP S/4HANA with SAP Extension Suite

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-DEV166)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-DEV166)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called DEV166 - Extend SAP S/4HANA with SAP Extension Suite.  


## Overview

This session introduces attendees to an end-to-end flow to build an extension using best practices from SAP Extension Suite.

This workshop will guide you step-by-step through the process of 
- creating new data models and a service using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)
- integrating a service exposed on the SAP API Business Hub
- creating a List Report Object Page application based on Fiori elements (FE) using the new service
- configuring and running a predefined Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and deploys your code changes to the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)

Please note that the inclusion of a service displayed in the SAP API Business Hub originates from a S/4 HANA Cloud system. While large parts of the tutorial are directed to consume the service from a real S/4 HANA Cloud system, the service will eventually not be consumed from a real system but from its local copy on the SAP BTP. This is because within this tutorial and using a SAP BTP trial account, no real S/4HANA Cloud system can be provided and configured.

This is what the final application will look like:
